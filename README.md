## 🎯 Logic Behind the Project

The program generates a business name by randomly selecting three parts:

1. **First Word** – Describes style or quality
   
   - Crazy
   
   - Amazing
    
   - Fire  

3. **Second Word** – Represents business category
   
   - Engine
     
   - Foods
     
   - Garments  

5. **Third Word** – Represents business type
 
   - Bros
    
   - Limited
     
   - Hub  

Each word is selected using JavaScript’s `Math.random()` function and conditional statements.

Example outputs:

- `Crazy Foods Hub`
  
- `Fire Engine Limited`
  
- `Amazing Garments Bros`

## 🧠 Code Explanation

- A random number is generated using `Math.random()`
  
- Based on the range of that number, a word is selected
  
- The process is repeated three times for three different words
  
- Finally, all words are combined and printed as a business name
